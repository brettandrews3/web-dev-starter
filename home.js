/*
Review if...else statements

Truthy and falsy expressions:
- '0' is true, but 0 is false
- EVERY number is true, except 0

Comparing === to ==
- Always use === and !== as a best practice
- JavaScript might try to convert types if you use == and !=

The ternary operator
- (condition) ? (true-statement) : (false-statement);

Block Scope
- Variables declared with let|const are block scoped and can't appear outside of it

Loops: for, while, do ... while()
- Be sure that the loops can complete at some point. Else, browser and server get in infinite loop
